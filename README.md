This app uses react-navigation v2. Everything changed in this version, so all of the navigation has been written from scratch.

Take a look at the comments in ./App-Stafflinq.js and in the various screens in ./App/Components for some help in understanding the quirks of react-navigation v2

After cloning:

$ yarn install

To launch in Expo

$ yarn start

To add Node modules

$ yarn add {name} --save
