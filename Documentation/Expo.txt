Running the App
--------------------------

Run this command to launch a control panel in your browser. Once it launches, you have different options on how to run the app:

$ expo start




Publishing
--------------------------

https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/publishing.html

Per the link above, here is a great section on OTA (over the air updates)

Deploying to the App Store and Play Store
When you're ready to distribute your app to end-users, you can create a standalone app binary (an ipa or apk file) and put it in the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store. See Distributing Your App.
The standalone app knows to look for updates at your app's published url, and if you publish an update then the next time a user opens your app they will automatically download the new version. These are commonly referred to as "Over the Air" (OTA) updates, the functionality is similar to CodePush, but it is built into Expo so you don't need to install anything.
To configure the way your app handles JS updates, see Offline Support.

App.json, set "privacy" to "unlisted"

{
  "expo": {
    "name": "Rosnet",
    "slug": "rosnet-app",
    "privacy": "unlisted",



Ejecting
---------------------------

Due to Expo's limitations, we ejected it using this command:

$ npm run eject

This will create separate /ios and /android directories
