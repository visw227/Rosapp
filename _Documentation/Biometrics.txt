PasscodeFallback only works if the user is not enrolled in touch id/face id.



//config is optional to be passed in on Android
const touchConfig = {
    title: "Authentication Required", // Android
    color: "#e00606", // Android,
    fallbackLabel: "", // use empty string to hide "Show Passcode" for now
    // iOS - ONLY allows the device to fall back to using the passcode, if faceid/touch is NOT available. 
    // this does not mean that if touchid/faceid fails the first few times it will revert to passcode, 
    // rather that if the former are not enrolled, then it will use the passcode.
    passcodeFallback: false
}
