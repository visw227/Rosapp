This project was started using this command:

$ react-native init Rosnet


Then I copied in the /App folder and ./App-Rosnet.js file from the app created in expo

Then I copied the expo project's depencies into this project's

Then tried to run the app...

$ react-native run-ios


Had errors. To get running, I had to install a couple of npm modules

$ yarn add react-native-vector-icons

React Navigation v3 requires react-native-gesture-handler

$ yarn add react-native-gesture-handler

AFTER installing react-native-gesture-handler, I had to link it

# react-native link
